# Boos_CSCI2270_FinalProject
# This project is going to be an attempt at implementing file compression using trees. I will be attempting to work out a likely fairly simplified version of Huffman data compression. Most likely, this will end up taking a text file, reading each character in it, and creating a tree that stores what those characters are, and how frequently they appear. The compression piece of the problem is a slightly more complex problem which I am not sure i will be able to approach, as this involves reading the tree and creating binary values for each character based on how frequently it appears in the text document. Therefore, this piece of the compression algorithm will likely be left out, leaving the final result of this project as a program that reads a text document, then builds a tree and stores the information such that the characters can be searched, and the program will output how many occasions of that character there were in the document.
